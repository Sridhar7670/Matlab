here is the code for basic MATLAB FUNCTIONS 
and as a part of my study i have done 
1. Amplitude shift keying ASK
2. Frequency Shift Keying (method 1, method 2)
3. Binary Phase Shift Keying
4. parallel to serial
5. serial to parallel
6. sqaure wave
7. few of the basic operations that can be made form MATLAB
8. basic Cosine and Sine wave Functions
9. and the main Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
10. by this there ends my matlab programme study
11. thanks for reading
